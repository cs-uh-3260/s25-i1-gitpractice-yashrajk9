--Paragraph--
I enjoyed reading the article "What Is Software Development?" because it provides a comprehensive and structured overview of the software development process in an easily digestible format. It breaks down the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) into six clear steps, making it simple for readers to understand how software is created from start to finish. The article also highlights the diverse career opportunities in software development, offering detailed role descriptions and salary insights. Furthermore, the inclusion of examples and practical explanations—such as the distinction between system software, application software, and programming languages—makes the content highly informative and engaging for anyone interested in a career in IT.
